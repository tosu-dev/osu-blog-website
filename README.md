# osu-blog-website
An osu! blog I created for my school work.

I'm in highschool, and I have informatics classes. I had to do a website about something we like. I decided to do a website about osu!. I decided to put in GitHub for several reasons :

1. I'm learning how GitHub works
2. To share what I've done
3. If I want to change the website
